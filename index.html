        pan, pour the water and bring it to a boil. Add pasta to the boiling water along with salt and oil, and cook the
        pasta for a few minutes. When its cooked, drain the extra water and transfer the pasta in another bowl. <br>

        Now add the peeled tomatoes, basil and parsley in the pan. Mix all the ingredients well and let it simmer for 10
        minutes until the sauce starts to thicken. When the sauce starts gaining consistency, put off the burner and add
        salt and black pepper powder to the sauce. Keep the sauce warm.<br> <br>

        Add the pasta over the warm sauce and toss with carefully. Serve it immediately. In fact, if you are someone who
        likes the cheesy version of pasta then you can garnish the pasta with some grated parmesan cheese and to make it

        fusion will make your pasta even more delectable. Serve it with garlic bread and relish this delicious pasta
